TEJASRI KANDIMALLA

During Summer 2022 semester, I worked under guidance of Prof Ricardo Silva for Neuroid Project, and its previous development is posted in GitHub. This helped me a lot understanding project's previous code and insights during further development. GitHub provides advantages like sharing our codes, descriptions and learning from otherâ€™s practical work. GitHub is knowledge sharing and gaining platform. As, I am curious about learning new things, GitHub provides a platform for it. These reasons motivated me in signup for GitHub.
